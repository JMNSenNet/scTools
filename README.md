# sctools
A package previously written to handle single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.
Currently, much of this is out of date, though there are functions and snippets of code that may come in handy for looking at an approach or repurposing. Please use caution when trying this code out - it isn't updated regularly, and dependencies (and R) have probably updated in that time.
